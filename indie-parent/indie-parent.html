            <p class="post-content-separator">---</p>

            <p>I am in parents shoes right now and I’m pushing myself and trying to manage marriage, baby, work, and side projects. It is difficult,
                the kid takes all the time I previously had for side projects and by saying this I am not complaining about it because the baby is the best thing that ever happened in my life, but this is the truth.</p>
            <p>As a parent and indie hacker at the same time, I find it quite difficult to manage the time and get at least a few hours a week for an indie hacker project.</p>

            <p>One day I decided to take a look at how I spend my time during the day. I would make a list of all things I do. If we exclude all the time spent on my job and with my family and a baby we get to the point of “free time”. In other words, this free time was not free as I would waste most of it and not be productive. I would waste it on YouTube, memes and social media, etc.</p>

            <p>So I concluded if I want to make my indie hacker career work I would need to change something right away.</p>

            <p>I have found a pattern which worked for me so far:</p>

            <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
                <li>disconnect from all social media</li>
                <li>limit time for watching YouTube/Netflix</li>
                <li>limit time on the internet doing random stuff</li>
                <li>limit or stop gaming</li>
                <li>limit time watching memes</li>
                <li>stop watching news</li>
                <li>remove every other distraction from my life that is not needed</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In general, you want to detect the time you spend during a day and remove everything which you think is not needed. The list above worked for me, maybe it will work for you too.</p>
